# Astrology Module

Version: 1.0.0  
Language: JavaScript  

The Astrology module is designed to help you retrieve astrological data based on a given date. As for now, the data it provides are the zodiac sign, the element, and the modality as well as validating dates.

The module is ideal for developers wanting to have easy access to astrological data or for those developing an astrology-based application.

**Features include:**
- Date validation
- Zodiac sign retrieval
- Element retrieval
- Modality retrieval

**The module allows you to:**  
Validate dates to ensure they are valid and in the correct YYYY-MM-DD format.
Retrieve the zodiac sign associated with a validated date.
Get additional astrological information, such as the element (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and modality (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) for a given zodiac sign.


# Installation

try {  
  const dateManager = new DateManager('2023-03-30')  
  const zodiacSign = dateManager.getZodiacSignObject().getZodiacSign()  
  const element = new Element(zodiacSign).getElement()  
  const modality = new Modality(zodiacSign).getModality()  
  
  console.log(`Zodiac sign: ${zodiacSign}`)  
  console.log(`Element: ${element}`)  
  console.log(`Modality: ${modality}`)  
} catch (error) {  
  console.log(error.message)  
}
